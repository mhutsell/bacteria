################### Section 1: Lin Fit for finding mu

# Since bacteria population is declining in later time values of our data, we can assume that ro is
# small. Not a perfect calculation, but good for getting a guess.

################### Section 2: Lin Fit for finding gmax - mu
# We know that at large values of ro, dn/dt = n(gmax-mu)
# At the beginning, ro is the largest that it will ever be, so the beginning has to have 'large' values of ro (for our data).
# To know when to stop taking data points, we simply looked at where the bacteria population began to stop displaying exponential
# growth. At that point, we can assume ro has become smaller and is no longer 'larger'. I put 'large' in quotes, because it being
# large is relative to our bacteria population's size, and so its exact numerical value can change from data set to data set.

# Take x and log(y) values from 0-31.
# We take log values of y because we assume growth to be exponential, and so this will allow us to fit linearly.

#################### Section 3: Finding a
# We know that, disregarding death of bacteria as we're just approximating, our
# amount of nutrient, 0.2 microgram/ml, led to the creation of roughly 2e8
# bacteria. Therefore, it takes 0,2 microgram/ml to make 2e8 bacteria per ml.
# so we can approximate 'a' by taking 2e8 and dividing it by 0.2. This will

#################### Section 4: Approximating nutrient decay due to bacterial growth


######## Finding the average y value for each x value
# We do this because when construct our "remaining nutrient" dictionary,
# It made more sense to us to have an average y value for each x value,
# So that we didn't have wildly different amounts for remaining nutrients
# on the same x value. It also made using a dictionary possible, as individual
# keys were unique vs trying to have a dictionary with 2 '4' keys.
